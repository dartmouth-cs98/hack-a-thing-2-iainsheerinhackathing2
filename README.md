Tutorial Used:
  * React Native Tutorials "The Net Ninja" on youtube. #9 -> #22
  * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLHFPt9B2Os

What I attempted to build:
  * I attempted to build a todo list app
  * I also explored other capabilities for react native for possible use in my future project
  * I used Expo to improve my ability to test both on my computer and on my phone
  * I used Flexbox as a way to format the design of the UI
  * I used react navigation as a way to navigate through multiple screens within the app
  
Who did what:
  * I did this project by myself.

What I learned:
  * I learned how to use React Native to build mobile apps for iOS and android
  * I learned how to use Expo
  * I learned how to build different components/views
  * I learned how to design buttons/layouts using Flexbox
  * I learned how to navigate through multiple screens within the app using react-navigation

How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?:
  * It inspires me to use Expo for easy testing
  * It also gives me ideas on how to design lists as well as other layouts for the mobile app we want to make
  * Also gives me a better idea on how to handle app navigation and data usage within the app.

What didn't work:
  * installing modules can be annoying if not done through expo/yarn. Definitely need to use those instead of npm
  * Need to understand more of the syntax of React Native/JS to fix bugs quicker. Often come from very small syntax errors.
